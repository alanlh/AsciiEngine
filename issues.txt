  Recently solved:
Support for text formatting (e.g. background color, text color),
Options on whether spaces should be transparent (?)
Support for animations
File system
Speed increases
Reusing animations

  Vital:
Change for of loops because it doesn't gracefully handle empty objects
Efficient way of rendering w/o iterating through all Drawings?
Need to handle events? What framework? Support for listeners, callbacks
Figure out which rendering systems to support.
Optimization in rendering. Two solutions:
  Store which pixels are changed and only update/access those.
  Treat each line as a single element, unless the formatting varies, to reduce the number of elements.

  Important:
Figure out how to include larger objects such as buttons/dropdown lists. Find solution AND figure out ASCII only solution
Support for on-hover dropdowns
How are frames and animations stored in files?
Let constructors accept strings and arrays instead of just Sets (user friendlier)

  Bonus:
More descriptive error messages (Print parameters for bad calls)
