  Recently solved:
File system
Speed increases
Event listeners
How are frames and animations stored in files?
Let constructors accept strings and arrays instead of just Sets (user friendlier)

  Vital:
Change for of loops because it doesn't gracefully handle empty objects
Efficient way of rendering w/o iterating through all Elements?
Figure out which rendering systems to support.
Optimization in rendering. Two solutions:
  [COMPLETED] Store which pixels are changed and only update/access those.
  Treat each line as a single element, unless the formatting varies, to reduce the number of elements.
  Update all elements at once, instead of per cell.
  Not sure if relevant, but check to be different before setting first. 
Optimization in event handling.
  Specifically, when mouse moves between multiple characters of the same FrameLayer, "mouseenter"/"mouseleave" events are always triggered.
  Need to find a way such that such events are only triggered when leaving the same FrameLayer. (Partially solved by second rendering optimization idea)
  Preliminary measurements suggest that while the time between each mouseleave and mouseenter is small (<0.1 ms). However, there are still two renders. 

  Important:
Figure out how to include larger objects such as buttons/dropdown lists. Find solution AND figure out ASCII only solution
Support for on-hover dropdowns
Hide certain methods from public. Only expose necessary methods. 
Allow frames to toggle frameLayers (?) for more versatility 
CSS for buttons, dropdowns, etc. 

  Bonus:
More descriptive error messages (Print parameters for bad calls)
Allow for formatting changes to be done automatically (?) (no event handlers for them specifically) 
Use Object.defineProperty whenever possible to prevent values from being changed.
