  Vital:
Where to store x, y? [Inside Drawing? Especially since Scene doesn't draw objects outside it.]
Efficient way of rendering w/o iterating through all Drawings?
Should start writing actual rendering function soon.
Need to handle events? What framework?

NOTE: Change most functions to public? Then add getters/setters to drawingData, idTags, and classMembers?

  Important:
Figure out how to include larger objects such as buttons/dropdown lists. Find solution AND figure out ASCII only solution


  Bonus:
More descriptive error messages (Print parameters for bad calls)
