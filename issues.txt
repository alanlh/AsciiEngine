  Vital:
Change for of loops because it doesn't gracefully handle empty objects 
Efficient way of rendering w/o iterating through all Drawings?
Need to handle events? What framework?
Figure out which rendering systems to support.

  Important:
Figure out how to include larger objects such as buttons/dropdown lists. Find solution AND figure out ASCII only solution
Support for animations, on-hover dropdowns
Support for text formatting (e.g. background color, text color),
Options on whether spaces should be transparent (?)
How are frames and animations stored in files?

  Bonus:
More descriptive error messages (Print parameters for bad calls)
