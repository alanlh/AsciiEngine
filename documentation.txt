NOTE: This documentation is mostly for my own purposes, and is likely to be incomplete/not updated in many places.

Options for Animations, Frames, and FrameLayers:
Animations: 
  startKey: The starting frame. Undefined behavior if not specified. 
  defaultKey: The default frame. Defaults to startKey if not specified. 
  events: Key value pairs which determine which events to listen for and how to handle them.
    Defaults to empty (no event listeners)
  settings: Currently unsupported. Might be relevant in future.   
  
Frames: 
  events: See above. 
  settings: Currently unsupported. 
  
FrameLayers:
  coords: (x,y) integer pair to determine where the FrameLayer is placed relative to the top left corner of the Frame
    Undefined behavior if negative. 
  formatting: determines how to format the text.
    Currently supports: color, backgroundColor, fontWeight ("bold"), fontStyle ("italics"), and textDecoration ("underline")
  events: See above.
  settings: determines various behavior
    spaceIsTransparent (true): If true, will render the next opaque object instead, or blank white if no objects behind
    spaceHasFormatting (false): If true, will still apply formatting options above, but use the character of the object behind it.
    setAsBlank (' '): The character is removed, but the formatting still applies.
      This is the most versatile option, since the above settings can't solve leading spaces. 
    leadingSpaceIgnored (true): Will not apply formatting to leading spaces if spaceIsTransparent is false or spaceHasFormatting is true [CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED]

NOTE: As of 6/1/19, everything below this is mostly out of date. 
In the unlikely case someone reads this and actually wants to use this, you're probably better off just looking through the code and examples.
It's not *particularly* complicated. 
Project:

A Project should be used for any element involving multiple scenes. Within the project, you can manage different scenes.
NOTE: This has not been implemented yet. 
Properties:
  scenes - dictionary of ids to Scenes
  sceneInfo - dictionary of ids to information about Scenes

Methods:
  Project(divId) - Creates a new empty project and assigns it to a certain div

  createScene(id, order = -1) - Creates a new empty Scene with width, height = 0. Also creates a div associated with it.
    If order is -1 or larger than # of scenes, then placed at end.

----------

Scene:
A Scene is a complete and indivisible unit. Scenes may be used by themselves or as part of a larger Project.
There are no safe-measures to ensure that scenes do not overlap. Please test your project on different screen sizes to ensure that they display properly.
If a scene is used by itself, the user should create a matching <div> element with the matching id.
  In this case, the div should be considered the property of the library. The user should not attempt to access the div without going through the Scene.
Scenes may contain text (converted to a Drawing object) or Drawings which are loaded from pre-existing text files.

All scenes should have a unique id. Reuse ids at your own risk.
All Drawings within a Scene should have different names. However, there may be cases where reusing the id may be beneficial. Use at your own risk.
Drawings in separate Scenes can freely share ids.

Properties (private):
  width - the width of the scene in terms of the number of characters.
  height - the height of the scene in terms of the number of lines.
  classMembers - A dictionary of class values to Sets of Drawings with that class name
  drawingData - Maps unique ids to drawing objects
  idTags - A dictionary containing the class names of the Drawing.

Methods:
  Scene(id) - Creates a new empty scene with width/height = 0 within the HTML "div" or "pre" element specified by id.
    NOTE: This constructor and the next should only be used when the Scene is not contained within some larger Project.
    NOTE: The div element should be created separately. Errors will occur if the div is not present.
    NOTE: If the HTML element specified by id is a "div", then another "pre" element will be created within it.
//?  Scene(id, width, height) - Creates a new empty scene with the desired width/height and assigns it to an div.

  setWidth(newWidth) - Changes the width of the scene. Will also change the display
  setHeight(newHeight) - Changes the height of the scene. Will also change the display

  addDrawing(classSet, drawing) - Adds a Drawing to the Scene. Returns a unique positive integer id if successful, -1 if not successful.
    NOTE: Reusing the unique id gives undefined behavior.
    NOTE: Ids are user-given names for each drawing, and may be repeated (similar to classes). Ids are unique to each object and are assigned by the library.
  addDrawingText(classSet, textStr) - Creates a Drawing from text and adds it to the Scene. Returns true if created successfully.
  addFile(idSet, fileLoc) - Adds the contents of a file to the Scene as a Drawing. Returns true if called successfully. Wrapper for addDrawing.
  shiftDrawing(classSet, shift) - Shifts all Drawing with the given class names by the given x, y value. (Must include all class names)
  moveDrawing(classSet, newLoc) - Moves all Drawings with the given class names to the given x, y value.
    NOTE: You probably don't want to use this if there are multiple Drawings with that same id.
    TODO: Alternatively, if classSet is a Set or Array, apply operation to class names. If just string, apply to id
  getDrawings(classSet) - Returns the ids of all Drawings which match all classes in classSet
    NOTE: Behavior is undefined if a string representing a single id is passed in
  orderDrawing(classSet, newPriority) - Changes the priority of all Drawings with the id. If two Drawings occupy the same space, the Drawing with the lower priority value is displayed.
    NOTE: Behavior is undefined if two Drawings with the same priority occupy the same spot.
    NOTE: All priority values should be positive, but won't be strictly checked. Non-positive values are reserved for other use.
    NOTE: At a certain space, if one Drawing is empty while another isn't, the character from the second Drawing will be displayed regardless of priority.
  removeDrawing(className) - Removes all drawings with that class name.

  getDrawings(classSet) - if NULL or empty, return entire set of drawings.
  getClassSet(id) - Gets the class names associated with the id. If not a valid id, return undefined

  RENDERING:
  Options:
    User manually calls render() every time they want to see a new frame
    Create a render(rate) function which calls render according to value specified by rate. User changes will be reflected in next refresh
      A value must be returned so that user can stop update once necessary
    Only changes when something is changed.

  Display Options:
    By default, blank characters have the lowest priority, regardless of drawing.
      However, this can be changed(?)

  render() - Updates what is currently displayed.

  addEventListener(idSet, type, handler) - Adds a click listener to all drawings with the id
    TYPES OF LISTENERS:
      "click" -
      "hover" -

  addCLickListener(id, handler) - Adds a click listener to a drawing with the id.
    NOTE: If only a certain part of a drawing should trigger a click, add a separate Drawing with a lower priority to simulate the same effect.
  addHoverDisplay(idList, type, text) -
----------
NOTE: All drawing levels can be created using the default constructor,
  or by reading in a filname, a string (according to how a file would be formatted), or an HTML string (though this might be removed)


Animation:
A collection of frames which may be animated.

Properties:
  (private):
    options_:
      loop - Whether the animation goes back to the beginning after the cycle
      manualIterate: Whether the animation progresses by itself or
    frames_: an array of Frames.
    iterationCounts_: how long each Frame should exist for (in terms of render counts)
    interationIndex_: Which index the animation is on.
    frameIndex_: Which frame the animation is on.

    priority_:
    width_, height_: max width and height of a constituent Frame
    x_, y_: x and y coordinates of the Animation

Methods:
    [Deprecated?] readFromFile(filename) - Creates an animation from a textfile.
      Each individual drawing should be marked using HTML and wrapped with <pre></pre> tags.
      If there is no beginning <pre> tag, it will be interpreted as a single Frame.
      Note that if there is a single '\n' after the <pre>, it will be ignored.
    [Deprecated?] addFrame(frame, iterationCount) - appends a frame
      iterationCount is optional and is 1 by default.
    getCharVal(x,y) - Gets the char at those coordinates. (Positive right down)
    nextFrame() - Lets the Animation know to increment the frame count.
    setOptions(newOptions) - sets the above options. Other properties will be ignored.
    setIds(idSet) - Sets a list of Ids so that the Scene can reference them later.

Frame:

  Types of inputs:
    PlainText - Enter as plain text drawing
    ReadFromFile - using HTML markup
      (planned) Supported formatting: text color, background color, bold, italics, underline, strikethrough

FrameLayer:
  Each FrameLayer has the same formatting and options.

  Formatting:
    There is preliminary support for 5 types of formatting:
      text color, background color, font weight (bold), font style (italics), and text decoration (underline/strikethrough)

    Formatting, by default, applies to only non-space characters. Spaces are ignored and are considered transparent
    Options allows you to change that. There are three settings currently supported:
      spaceIsTransparent (boolean): This causes the space to not be transparent, but does not apply any of the other settings (i.e. background color is white)
      spaceHasFormatting (boolean): This causes the space to take the same formatting as everything else.
      setAsBlank (character): This replaces any copies of that character with a blank, and applies formatting as well. This is probably the most useful setting.

      PLANNED:
      leadingSpaceIgnored (boolean): This sets all leading spaces of each line to be transparent regardless of the other options. Any other spaces will be set according to the options above.
      spaceHasFormattingOnly (boolean): Applies formatting, but selects the character (only) from the next framelayer if there is one
        NOTE: This is not a necessary feature, but it might make visualizing certain drawings easier


    Alternate Constructors:
      createFrameLayerFromFile (filename): Assumes that the file uses the custom format
      createFrameFromString (string): String version of JSON.
        NOTE: These two constructors will remove the first leading newline, if there is one.

******* NO LONGER USED ***************
Drawing:
A Drawing object is either created from a text string or a file location. In

Properties:
  drawingText - the text of the Drawing, including line breaks.
    The line break at the end is optional
  width, height - height/width of Drawing, to save computation.

  priority - the priority of the Drawing in the scene. Default 0. Low priority is in front
  textFormat - formatting, including background color, text color, bold, etc. represented w/ dictionary


  Drawing(textStr, width, height) - Creates a new empty drawing with the given text.
    width and height are optional arguments, but either both should be included, or none.

  getCharVal(x,y) - Gets the char at those coordinates. (Positive right down)
  setIds(idSet) - Sets a list of Ids so that the Scene can reference them later.

  NOTE: A Drawing's Scene-related properties should be stored in a separate dictionary???????
