  Refined example
  Bug fixes

Version 0.6.0 - 2019/7/21
  Rewrote entire project to be more versatile, moved old code to src_old and SampleProjectOld folder. New code is in src and SampleProject folder. 
    Previous code will be deleted by next patch. 
  Implemented basic features in new version:
    Most data structures for creating and rendering objects (now named Elements)
    Rendering
    Formatting
  Not yet implemented:
    Events
    Parsing
  Added documentation for new structure (incomplete, but more than previously). 

Version 0.4.2 - 2019/6/29
  Slightly restructured code
  Added "use strict" to all functions. 

Version 0.4.1 - 2019/6/23
  Allows frame layers to have multiple formatting options. 
    Simplifies temporary formatting effects (e.g. bold on hover)
  Optimizations of event listener handling. 
  Updated examples. 

Version 0.4 - 2019/6/15
  Added event listeners support
    Event handlers are passed in to a scene, with each handler referenced by a name.
    Listeners can be added at the Scene, Animation, Frame, and FrameLayer levels, but are all executed at the Scene level. 
    Listeners are passed in as key-value pairs, with the key being the event being listened to
      and the value being the name of the handler. 
  Original options values for FrameLayers are renamed to "settings", and are placed within the overall "options" object. See examples. 
  Modified Animation, Frame, and FrameLayer parameter list. 
  Added JSON error messages to parsing for easier debugging. 
  Updated examples. 


Version 0.3.3 - 2019/6/1
  MAJOR: Changed Animation organization to be non-linear, giving greater flexibility.  
    Frames are now named, and user specifies which frame to switch to.
    Future updates should make this easier to manage (e.g. linear execution). 
    Updated examples as well.
