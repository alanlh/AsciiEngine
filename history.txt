History:
Version 0.4 - 2019/6/15
  Added event listeners support
    Event handlers are passed in to a scene, with each handler referenced by a name.
    Listeners can be added at the Scene, Animation, Frame, and FrameLayer levels, but are all executed at the Scene level. 
    Listeners are passed in as key-value pairs, with the key being the event being listened to
      and the value being the name of the handler. 
  Original options values for FrameLayers are renamed to "settings", and are placed within the overall "options" object. See examples. 
  Modified Animation, Frame, and FrameLayer parameter list. 
  Added JSON error messages to parsing for easier debugging. 
  Updated examples. 


Version 0.3.3 - 2019/6/1
  MAJOR: Changed Animation organization to be non-linear, giving greater flexibility.  
    Frames are now named, and user specifies which frame to switch to.
    Future updates should make this easier to manage (e.g. linear execution). 
    Updated examples as well.
     
Version 0.3.2.1 - 2019/3/7

Version 0.3.2 - 2019/3/1
  Animations, Frames, and FrameLayers are now reusable.
