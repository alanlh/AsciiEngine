# AsciiEngine
Hello stranger. If you exist and are interested in doing anything with this repo (read through, follow, use (?), adapt (???), contribute(???????), etc.), please continue reading below.

AsciiEngine is a library written in vanilla JS to display and animate ASCII art. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface for displaying ASCII art in a browser, especially within the context of games. Most core features, such as displaying text, support for some CSS options (e.g. text color, background color), and event handling, have been completed. To what AsciiEngine can do, see the GitHub Pages for this repo, at https://alanlh.github.io/AsciiEngine/. As of 01/15/2020, I have decided to include a full game engine as part of this project.

I was inspired to create AsciiEngine after playing various games with ASCII graphics, most notably, Candy Box and Candy Box 2 (can be played at https://candybox2.github.io/). After wanting to make such a game of my own and thinking about how such a game would be made, I decided to create AsciiEngine as an intermediate step. There are a few more features I would like to implement. Once those are done, I will only work on what is necessary for said game, and most likely halt all progress soon after that is complete (unless there is external interest otherwise).

In the off chance that you do wish to use this library in any manner, please cite this repo. Thanks!
